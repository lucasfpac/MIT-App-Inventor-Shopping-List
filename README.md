# Shopping List

The shopping list app was developed using MIT App Inventor. The main objective of the app is to assist users in creating and managing their shopping lists. The design process involved two screens: a welcome screen with a notification, an image, and a "Start Shopping" button, and a main screen with a heading, a label, a textbox, and various buttons.

The app's functionality allows users to add items to the list by typing them into the textbox and clicking the "Add" button. If the textbox is empty, an error message is displayed. The list of items is presented in a user-friendly list view, and users can delete items by tapping on them, which triggers a confirmation alert.

Additionally, the app features a "Clear Items" button, which, when clicked, displays a confirmation alert and removes all items from the list. The design aimed to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface by incorporating icons, color schemes, and visual consistency.

During the development process, challenges were encountered in implementing the deletion functionality and handling user input validation. However, with perseverance and problem-solving, these issues were successfully resolved.

Overall, the shopping list app provides a simple and efficient way for users to create and manage their shopping lists, improving their shopping experience and organization.
